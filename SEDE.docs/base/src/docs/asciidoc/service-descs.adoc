This document contains a user guide for service descriptions. For the development guide, see: {todo}.

== What is a service description?

A service description contains meta-information about a software library which *describes* how to deploy, configure, run and compose its functionality.
Given this, the library integrates into the SEDE-Framework and its units of functionality can be offered as a *set of service*.

== Why a domain specific language?
